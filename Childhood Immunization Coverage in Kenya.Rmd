# Introduction

Child immunization is a highly cost-effective program which fosters health equity for the entire population. According to the World Health Organization Immunization Agenda 2030, equity and coverage are strategic priority goals to ensuring that everyone, regardless of where they live, can access life-saving vaccines. Kenya has made notable progress in expanding its immunization programs over the years, resulting in increased vaccination coverage and a reduction in vaccine-preventable diseases. The government, in collaboration with both national and international partners and organizations e.g. KEMRI and WHO, has implemented various policies and strategies to enhance immunization access and equity all over the country. Despite these efforts, disparities are still present in immunization coverage. The disparities are driven by socioeconomic, maternal, geographic, child, and place of birth factors.

The disparities in immunization coverage can have profound implications for the overall health and well-being of children and can undermine the achievement of immunization targets set by the World Health Organization, as most children remain vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates. Addressing these inequities is crucial to achieving universal immunization coverage and improving the health outcomes of all children in Kenya.

# Study Objective

The main objective of this study was to assess the coverage of childhood immunization in Kenya among children aged 12 â€“ 23 months based on socioeconomic, geographic, maternal, child, and place of birth characteristics.

We've selected 51 variables of interest, observations are still 3561.

# Descriptive characteristics 

We'll calculate the mean coverage of full immunization, as well as the mean coverage of individual vaccines at the National Level, in order to determine the overall childhood immunization coverage rates in Kenya.

# Data Visualization

We want to visualize the socioeconomic, geographical, maternal, child and place of birth characteristics based on full vaccination. The plots are only for full vaccinated children.

```{r}
# First filter the data for children who were fully vaccinated
full_vac_data <- data |> filter(full_vac == 1)
```

```{r}
# Full vaccination Vs Birth order
ggplot(full_vac_data, aes(x = birth_order, fill = birth_order)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Birth Order", 
       x = NULL, y = "Frequency", 
       fill = "Birth Order") +
  coord_flip()
```

The most vaccinated children were second or third born. Quite a number of firstborns also received full vaccination.

```{r}
# Full vaccination Vs Maternal age at birth
ggplot(full_vac_data, aes(x = matagebirth3, fill = matagebirth3)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Maternal Age at Birth", 
       x = NULL, y = "Frequency", 
       fill = "Maternal Age at Birth") + 
  coord_flip()
```

Most of the fully vaccinated children were for mothers aged 20 to 29 years, followed by mothers aged 30 years and above.

```{r}
# Full vaccination Vs Household Head
ggplot(full_vac_data, aes(x = motherhhd, fill = motherhhd)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Head of Household", 
       x = NULL, 
       y = "Frequency", 
       fill = "Head of Household") + 
  coord_flip()
```

Most of the children who received full vaccination came from households which are not headed by the mother.

```{r}
# Full vaccination Vs Delivery(place of birth setting)
ggplot(full_vac_data, aes(x = delivery, fill = delivery)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Place of Birth Setting", 
       x = NULL, y = "Frequency", 
       fill = "Place of Birth Setting") + 
  coord_flip()
```

Most of the children who were fully vaccinated were born in a clinical setting.

```{r}
# Full vaccination Vs sex of child
ggplot(full_vac_data, aes(x = sex, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Sex of Child", 
       x = NULL, y = "Frequency", 
       fill = "Sex") + 
  coord_flip()
```

Male babies were more than female babies, that is for those who were fully vaccinated. The difference is however minimal.

```{r}
# Full vaccination Vs maternal education
ggplot(full_vac_data, aes(x = educ, fill = educ)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Maternal Education", 
       x = NULL, y = "Frequency", 
       fill = "Maternal Education") + 
  coord_flip()
```

Most of the fully vaccinated children were for mothers with secondary education, followed by primary then tertiary education. Few mothers with no formal education also got their children vaccinated.

```{r}
# Full vaccination Vs wealth status
ggplot(full_vac_data, aes(x = wealth, fill = wealth)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Wealth Status", 
       x = NULL, y = "Frequency", 
       fill = "Wealth Status") + 
  coord_flip()
```

Most children who were fully vaccinated came from richer households.

```{r}
# Full vaccination Vs Religion
ggplot(full_vac_data, aes(x = religion, fill = religion)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Religion", x = NULL, 
       y = "Frequency", fill = "Religion") + 
  coord_flip()
```

Most of the fully vaccinated children were from christian homes.

```{r}
# Full vaccination Vs Place of residence(rural/urban)
ggplot(full_vac_data, aes(x = rural, fill = rural)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Residential Place", 
       x = NULL, y = "Frequency", 
       fill = "Residential Place") + 
  coord_flip()

```

Most of the fully vaccinated children were from rural home settings.

```{r}
# Full vaccination Vs union/partnership
ggplot(full_vac_data, aes(x = union, fill = union)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "Partnership Status", 
       x = NULL, y = "Frequency", 
       fill = "Partnership Status") + 
  coord_flip()
```

Children whose mothers are currently married were the highest with regards to full vaccination.

```{r}
# Full vaccination Vs County/region
ggplot(full_vac_data, aes(x = county, fill = county)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title = "County/Region", x = NULL, 
       y = "Frequency", fill = "County") + 
  coord_flip()
```

Most of the fully vaccinated children were from Migori county, followed by Kakamega, Bungoma, Nakuru and Kwale. We noted that Garissa county only had 1 fully immunized child, Mandera had 2 and Wajir had 3.


# Measures of Association between full Immunization and Socioeconomic, Geographical, Maternal, Child and Place of birth characteristics.

We want to test the hypothesis that;

* Ho: There is no association between full vaccination and the socioeconomic, geographical, maternal, child and place of birth characteristics.
* Ha: There is association between full vaccination and the socioeconomic, geographical, maternal, child and place of birth characteristics.

## 1. Socioeconomic Characteristics.

```{r}
## 1. Wealth status

# Contingency table
Table_1 <- xtabs(~ full_vac + wealth, data = data)
Table_1
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test of independence
chi_1 <- chisq.test(Table_1)
chi_1
```

The p-value < 0.05, implying that there's an association between full vaccination and wealth status.

```{r}
## 2. Union/partnership status

# Contingency table
Table_2 <- xtabs(~ full_vac + union, data = data)
Table_2
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test of independence
chi_2 <- chisq.test(Table_2)
chi_2
```

The p-value > 0.05, implying that there's no association between full vaccination and union/partnership status.

```{r}
## 3. Religion

# Contingency table
Table_3 <- xtabs(~ full_vac + religion, data = data)
Table_3
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test of independence
chi_3 <- chisq.test(Table_3)
chi_3
```

The p-value < 0.05, implying that there's an association between full vaccination and religion.

## 2.Geographical Characteristics

```{r}
## 4. Place of residence

# Contingency table
Table_4 <- xtabs(~ full_vac + rural, data = data)
Table_4
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test of independence
chi_4 <- chisq.test(Table_4)
chi_4
```

The p-value < 0.05, implying that there's an association between full vaccination and place of residence.

```{r}
## 5. County

# Contingency table
Table_5 <- xtabs(~ full_vac + county, data = data)
Table_5
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test of independence
chi_5 <- chisq.test(Table_5)
chi_5
```

The p-value < 0.05, implying that there's an association between full vaccination and county/region.

## 3. Maternal Characteristics

```{r}
## 6. Maternal Education

# Contingency table
Table_6 <- xtabs(~ full_vac + educ, data = data)
Table_6
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test of independence
chi_6 <- chisq.test(Table_6)
chi_6
```

The p-value < 0.05, implying that there's an association between full vaccination and maternal education.

```{r}
## 7. Mother household head

# Contingency table
Table_7 <- xtabs(~ full_vac + motherhhd, data = data)
Table_7
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test
chi_7 <- chisq.test(Table_7)
chi_7
```

The p-value > 0.05, implying that there's no association between full vaccination and the mother being household head.

```{r}
## 8. Maternal Age at Birth

# Contingency table
Table_8 <- xtabs(~ full_vac + matagebirth3, data = data)
Table_8
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test of independence
chi_8 <- chisq.test(Table_8)
chi_8
```

The p-value < 0.05, implying that there's an association between full vaccination and the maternal age at birth.

## 4. Child Characteristics

```{r}
## 9. Birth Order

# Contingency table
Table_9 <- xtabs(~ full_vac + birth_order, data = data)
Table_9
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test of independence
chi_9 <- chisq.test(Table_9)
chi_9
```

The p-value < 0.05, implying that there's an association between full vaccination and the birth order.

```{r}
## 10. Sex of child

# Contingency table
Table_10 <- xtabs(~ full_vac + sex, data = data)
Table_10
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test of independence
chi_10 <- chisq.test(Table_10)
chi_10
```

The p-value > 0.05, implying that there's no association between full vaccination and the sex of the child.

## 5. Place of Birth Characteristics

```{r}
## 11. Delivery (Place of birth setting)

# Contingency table
Table_11 <- xtabs(~ full_vac + delivery, data = data)
Table_11
```

```{r}
# Chi-square test of independence
chi_11 <- chisq.test(Table_11)
chi_11
```
 
The p-value < 0.05, implying that there's an association between full vaccination and the delivery/place of birth setting. There's a warning due to the very small number of observations in the last cell of the contingency table.


# Logistic Regression Model

We'll fit a Multiple Logistic Regression Model so that we can describe the relationship between full vaccination and the socioeconomic, geographical, maternal, child and place of birth characteristics. We'll only include variables that have shown significant associations with full vaccination from the chi-square tests of independence.

```{r}
# Fit the model
Logistic_Model <- glm(full_vac ~ wealth + religion + rural + educ +
                        matagebirth3 + birth_order + delivery + county, data = data,
                      family = "binomial")

```

```{r}
# Model summary
summary(Logistic_Model)
```


# Create Table for the Logistic Regression Model Results

I'll use the tab_model() function from sjPlot package to create a table for the Multiple Logistic Regression model. The function will convert the log-odds into odds ratios, which are easy to interpret.

```{r}
# Create table for the model
tab_model(Logistic_Model)
```

## Socioeconomic characteristics

* Children born in richer families had 67% higher odds of full immunization compared to children born in poorest families. 
* Children born in richest households had 78% higher odds of full immunization compared to children born in poorest households.

## Maternal Characteristics

* The odds for children of mothers with primary education being fully immunized were 2.02 times the odds for children whose mothers had no education.
* The odds for children of mothers with secondary education being fully immunized were 1.95 times the odds for children whose mothers had no education.
* The odds for children of mothers with higher (college or university) education being fully immunized were 1.83 times the odds for children whose mothers had no education.
* Children of mothers aged 20-29 years had 68% higher odds of full immunization compared to children of mothers aged below 20 years. 
* Children of mothers aged 30 years and above had 89% higher odds of full immunization compared to children of mothers aged below 20 years. 

## Child characteristics

* Children who were sixth born or higher had 57% lower odds of full immunization.

## Geographical Characteristics

Mombasa county was our reference level, based on how the data was coded.

* Children in Garissa county had 88.42% lower odds of full immunization compared to children in Mombasa county. 
* Children in Mandera county had 84.71% lower odds of full immunization in comparison to children in Mombasa county. 
* Children in West Pokot county had 64.8% lower odds of full immunization compared to children in Mombasa county. 
* Children in Samburu county had 71.38% lower odds of full immunization compared to children in Mombasa county. 
* Children in Narok county had 62.82% lower odds of full immunization compared to children in Mombasa county. 

The Logistic Regression model though, had a lower adjusted R2 because most of the independent variables in the model were not statistically significant.
